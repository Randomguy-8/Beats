## Beats !||!

Thats a music player which run on any envirnoment unless it supports bash.
<br>
### Usage
./beats <file_name> | Here file_name includes its extension too.
<br><br> 
Remember file_name shouldn't contain whitespace, eg: if the file_name is "Make you mine.mp3" then rmove its spaces and reexecute. <br> and also you should have to execute file from the same directory, where the tool is present eg: if you are executing it like this "./Downloads/beats music.mp3" then it may not work so you have to cd to same directory and then execute it.

### Note
it uses ffmpeg to run(dependency). so it in most of ubuntu based system its already installed but if its not then it will help you too install it :)
