## Beats !||!

A console based music player!
<br>
<br><br> 
Remember file_name shouldn't contain whitespace, eg: if the file_name is "Make you mine.mp3" then rmove its spaces and reexecute. <br> and also you should have to execute file from the same directory, where the tool is present eg: if you are executing it like this "./Downloads/beats music.mp3" then it may not work so you have to cd to same directory and then execute it.

### Note
I dont want to call it beta verson but there are still alot of thins i need to work on: <br><br>

It need `ffmpeg` to run(depedency), It will automatically download, if not already installed (work only with ubuntu based systems).
Only support mp3 format yet!
